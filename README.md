# personalized_medicine
Hi there! These are my results for the Personalized Medicine Kaggle Competition. Included is the actual notebook, personalized_medicine.ipynb, as well as the HTML version of the notebook, personalized_medicine.html. Not included here is the "input" directory, which will need to be populated with the four data files found at https://www.kaggle.com/c/msk-redefining-cancer-treatment/data:  test_text.zip, train_text.zip, test_variations.zip, and train_variations.zip.

The notebook assumes that these files are unzipped and available in the ./input folder. Note that the notebook will need to be run on a machine with at least 32GB of memory, since part of the analysis performs dimensionality reduction via truncated SVD on a rather large input matrix.

Enjoy!
